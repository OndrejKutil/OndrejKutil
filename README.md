## 👋 Hi, I’m Ondřej Kutil

I'm a student of IT & Finance based in Prague. I build data-driven tools that combine financial insight with backend logic, automation, and visual storytelling.

I'm currently interested in student junior roles/internships that connect finance, data and tech - Investment analytics to systems that help decision making.
I want to build my career and contribute to solving real problems while still studying
